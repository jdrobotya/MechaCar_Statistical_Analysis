# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Deliverable 1 

1. According to the p-values we received for vehicle_length  and ground_clearance, they willprovide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset and will have the biggest impact. 

2. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, since p-value is smaller then 0.05%, Null Hypothesis can be rejected. 

3. Yes, this linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes  with %71.5 effectivness (R-squared is 0.7149).

## Deliverable 2 

Accordint to the total_summary output, the suspension coil variance is 62.29356, which dosen't exceed required 100 pounds per square inch.

Lot 1 and Lot 2  still meet the requirment after the data was breaken down by lot (lot-summary), but Lot 3 had exceeded 100 pounds per squere inch, it was 170. It means that current manufacturing  data doesn't  meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots, but meets it for Lot 1 and 2.
