# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Deliverable 1 

1. According to the p-values we received for vehicle_length  and ground_clearance, they will a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset and will have the biggest impact. 

2.The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, since p-value is smaller then 0.05%, Null Hypothesis can be rejected. 

3. Yes, this linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes  with %71.5 effectivness (R-squared is 0.7149).
