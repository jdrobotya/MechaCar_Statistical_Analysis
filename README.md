Deliverable 1 

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
According to the p-values we received for vehicle_length  and ground_clearance, they will a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset and will have the biggest impact. 

2.Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, since p-value is smaller then 0.05%, Null Hypothesis can be rejected. 

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, this linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes  with %71.5 effectivness (R-squared is 0.7149).
